# Update Hub

Update Hub is a new Linux Debian GUI (or any system that uses APT) written in Python designed to make your Linux experience nice and smooth.

## Installation
Using the terminal (The only time you will!), run:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Coming soon to APT (Hopefully)
```sh
sudo apt install update-hub
```

Upgrades can be done from the GUI itself!

## Usage
First, you will notice 3 tabs at the top of the page. The first tab is used for system upgrades (full functions coming soon).
<br>
The second tab is used for pacakge upgrades. Click refresh to update package lists and click all the packages you want to update. (All package upgrade coming soon).
<br>
The third tab is used for install/removal of packages. Search any packages, click the ones you want, (Dependencies auto installed), and it will ask for approval and install the packages!<br>
